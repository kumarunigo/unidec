Simple Data - "PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE"
1) number : 
	byte ( 1 byte ) : -128 to +127 
	short (2 byte ) : -32k to + 32k
	int ( 4 byte ) : -2billion to + 2 billion
	long ( 8 byte) : trillions
2) decimal number
	float ( 4 bytes) : 6 decimal point accuracy
	double ( 8 bytes) : 
3) yes/no
	boolean 
4) 1 character : A-Z , 0-9, special character
	char
	
Complex Data - "OBJECT DATA TYPE"
1) group of characters
	firstname : john
	String 
2) sub information ;
	address : 123 , abcd street, city, state, 12345
	new program to be created


**************************

int a=30; 
	int = data type
	a   =  variable ( can change ) 
	30 = value

int b; // declaration line... declare variable named b is capable of storing numbered value
int c=20;  // initialization.... when value has been given/assigned to a variabel FIRST time 
c=30;      // re-assignment
 

float weight;
weight=123.1f;
weight=125.1f;


int age=123;
	int is a data type
	age is a variable
	123 is a value
	age is variable capable of storing numbered value
	int age is declaratiion
	age=123; is initialization


int a=10;
int b=a;
int c=10+20;
int d=10+c;

	
 *********** Declaration rules ***********
	Declaration line includes.... Data type followed by variable name
	variable cannot be assigned with a value before declaration a data type
	variable names : same program and same block
		u cannot have 2 similar variable names
		can contain alphabets, numbers, $, _
		start with alphabet or $ or _ 
		coding practice
			naming convention - camelCase
			choose a relevant meaningful names
	
	
******** initialization rules ****
	Value assigned to a variable for the FIRST time.
	values should match the data type on LHS
	RHS can be literal value OR variable of same type OR expression OR method call
	
Always process RHS and convert into a single value
equal sign RULES... 
1) LHS should always be a variable
2) RHS can have values , variable, expressions
	int a=10; // literal value
	
	when RHS has variable 
	int b=a; (replace value of RHS variable)
	int b=10; 
	
	when RHS is expression
	int c=10+20-10+44; (solve the expression)
	int c=64;
	
	int d=10+c; ( 1-replace all RHS variable value...  2-solve the expression)
	int d=10+64; 
	int d=74; 
	
	when RHS is method call.. replace the returned result from method call
	int result=cal.add(10,20);  
	int result=30;  


********* Accessing Data ********* 
	same program : direct access 
	outside program : accessed with reference to the program using dot operator



Methods :
	********* Method Declaration	*********
		how to recognize methods : Does-A exercise
		how to code methods :
			What to name this activity ??? <<NAME>>
			how many inputs are required ??? what are the data type of each inputs ???
			how many outputs are required ??? what is the data type of each output ???
		
		PUBLIC 	OUTPUT 	NAME	(INPUT)
	
	
		NAME : similar rules as variables
			Follow camelCase format in method names
			Alphabets , numbers, $, _ allowed in method names
	
		OUTPUT : CAN ALWAYS BE 0 or 1 
			0 = void  ... 
				public  void hello(String message)
			1 = appropriate data type, int/boolean... 
				public int add(int a, int b)
			more than 1 = complex or multiple infor to return, create an object data type 
				public Profile display(String userid)
				
		INPUT : CAN ALWAYS BE 0 or MORE 
			0 = if no input require, leave it empty
				public int bye(  )
			More = if more than 1 input , separated by comma. data type followed by the name 
				public int add(int number1, int number2)

	********* Method Body - logic/ instructions ********* 
	
		LOGIC : use control flows and operators for logic.
		
		
		RETURN STATEMENT :
		
			if void output - no return required
			if anything but void - return required
				primitive data type - 
					literal value that matches output data type 
						or 
					variable that matches output data type 
				Object /complex data type
					variable that matches output data type
